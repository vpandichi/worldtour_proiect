Simple - they have all sojourned in Taormina, the pearl of the Mediterranean. <span class="rmore">[Read more...]</span><br/><br/>

						<article id="hidden_article">
							Taormina is centred around its main thoroughfare, Corso Umberto I. At the beginning of this charming street is perhaps the greatest symbol of Taormina’s long varied history: Palazzo Corvaja. Its architecture is a sublime mix of Arab, Norman and Gothic and includes battlements, mullioned windows and shady courtyards. The Arabs built the original tower as part of the town’s defences. Its cubic structure, which is typical of many Arab towers of this period, is thought to have evoked that of the Ka’aba in Mecca. In the 13th Century the tower was enlarged by the Normans who added a wing containing a hall and some wonderful artwork. The Spanish followed suit, adding another wing at the beginning of the 15th Century to house the Sicilian Parliament. Its present name recalls one of the town’s most important noble families who owned the building from 1538 to 1945.<br/><br/>
							For the first half of the 20th Century, until after the 2nd World War, Palazzo Corvaja became a kind of lodging house for poor families and fell into disrepair. After the war it was restored to its former glory and in 1960 another section was added to house the local tourism offices. The main part now houses the Sicilian Museum of Art and Popular Traditions.<br/><br/>
							At the other end of Corso Umberto I is Piazza del Duomo, complete with 13th Century Cathedral and Baroque fountain. As with many churches of this period in Sicily, the Duomo, dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Bari, has a distinctly fortress-like quality thanks to its robust structure and the battlements that delineate the roof. Its Renaissance doorway belies an essentially Gothic interior complete with a rose window at the west end.<br/><br/>
							Taormina is served by its very own cable car which ferries tourists to and from the seaside resorts down along the coast. Extensive beaches, rocky coves, tiny islands (such as the famous Isola Bella) and sea stacks abound, making this enchanting coastline a firm favourite with Sicilians and visitors alike. <span class="vless">[View less...]</span> <br/><br/>

							<h3>Places to see</h3>
							For a real taste of Sicily try a Sunday morning in Castelbuono, south of Cefalù; think Sicilian Ludlow. The shops move outside and tastings are obligatory. An eclectic mix of sausages and salamis, preserves and chocolates, amazing biscuits and cakes, gelato in a multitude of flavours and panettone – so many types – and delectable spreads (try the smooth “cream of almond” on freshly baked panettone, so light it almost floats away).
							This is not a tourist attraction, so be prepared to jostle with the local children who are on the front row for tastings, then have a break from free samples and sit in the square to enjoy an espresso, the church bells and a spot of people watching. Heavenly.<br/><br/>
							<h3>Atmospheric amphitheatres</h3>
							Starting from Catania, you could make Siracusa, with its beautiful medieval buildings and Greek amphitheatre, your first stop. Try the fish restaurants before heading for Agrigento, with its classical temples. Continue to unmissable Segesta and, perhaps, Selinunte; both wind-swept classical temple sites. Stay on the coast at Castellammare del Golfo, where pastel-painted houses tumble down to the harbour (fish baked in salt is memorable here); farther along there's pretty Cefalù.
							Busy Palermo is worth a visit, then head up into the mountains to Castelbuono to see real, old atmospheric Sicily, before driving on to stay near Taormina. Here, visit the spectacular amphitheatre – but make sure you go early.<br/><br/>
							<h3>Make your own way around</h3>
							We stayed at the Costa Azul hotel, a small modern hotel close to the beach on the Gulf of Castellammare, and an energetic walk from Balestrate (beware of stray dogs and broken glass and litter on the sand). We hired a taxi rather than going on trips organised by the hotel, which was cheaper and more convenient.
							We recommend stopping at Antica Pasticceria del Convento (Via Vittorio Emanuele II 14), a pastry shop in the medieval fortress town of Erice; visiting Trapani, the old town, which is architecturally stunning with its quaint squares; taking a guided tour of a Marsala wine distillery; and not missing the windmills at Infersa salt pans.<br/><br/>
							<h3>Siracusa's war graves</h3>
							Fascinating as Siracusa's ancient ruins are, our lasting memory is of the Commonwealth World War Two cemetery, where young men who died in the 1943 landings lie under rows of white headstones in trimmed green grass. Sobering in the heat.<br/><br/>

				<h1 class="content_headers">Iasi, Romania</h1>
				<article  id="article1">
					<img src="/sites/worldtour/public/img/iasi.jpg" alt="Iasi" id="iasi"> 
					Iasi is the most important political, economic and cultural centre of the province of Moldavia as well as one of the oldest cities in Romania. Located in the northeastern part of the country, Iasi was for many centuries the crossing point of the most important commercial routes linking Poland, Hungary, Russia and Constantinople. <span class="rmore">[Read more...]</span><br/><br/>
					<div class="article_more1">
						<article id="hidden_article1">
							Deeply rooted in history, Iasi has been the main centre of Moldavian culture since 1408. The city prides itself with publishing the first Romanian newspaper and establishing the first Romanian university. Today, Iasi is home to five universities.<br/><br/>
							Over the past 500 years, history, culture and religious life have molded the city's unique character. Iasi boasts an impressive number of Orthodox churches, almost 100, most of them located in the so-called Golden Plateau (Platoul de Aur). The oldest, the Princely Saint Nicholas Church, dates from the reign of Stephen the Great (Stefan cel Mare, 1457-1504). The finest, however, are the 17th century St. Paraschiva Metropolitan Cathedral and Trei Ierarhi Church, the last a curious example of Byzantine art, erected in 1635-1639 by Vasile Lupu. Its outer walls and twin towers are intricately carved in what many think of as stone lace.<br/><br/>
							The Golden Plateau represents the nucleus of the city, around which the entire settlement developed over the centuries. With the Palace of Culture at one end and theUnion Square (Piata Unirii) at the other, the Golden Plateau features churches and princely palaces on both sides of Stefan cel Mare si Sfant Boulevard, which runs right through its centre. Many other important sites can be found on nearby streets. <span class="vless">[View less...]</span> <br/><br/>

							<h3>Landmarks</h3><br>
							<h4>Palace of Culture (Palatul Culturii)</h4>
							Address: Piata Stefan cel Mare si Sfant 1<br>
							Open: Tue. - Sun 10:00am - 5:00pm; closed on Mondays<br>
							Free admission (not including museums)<br><br>
							This remarkable construction (1906-1925), built in flamboyant neogothic style, stands partly on the ruins of a medieval royal court mentioned in documents dating from 1434. Today, the 365-room palace houses the Gheorghe Asachi Library and four of the city's museums: the Moldavian History Museum, the Ethnographic Museum, the Museum of Art and the Museum of Science and Technology (see museum details). The interior décor, with the lavish furnishings and magnificent staircase of the entrance lobby, can be admired free of charge, but tickets are required for entry to the museums. <br/><br/>
							<h4>St. Paraschiva Metropolitan Cathedral (Catedrala Mitropolitana Sfanta Paraschiva)</h4>
							Address: Blvd. Stefan cel Mare si Sfant 46<br>
							Open: Mon. - Sun. 9:00am - 8:00pm<br>
							Free admission<br><br>
							Built in Italian Renaissance style, the St. Paraschiva Metropolitan Cathedral is the largest Orthodox church in Romania. Construction began in 1833 and ended in 1839, but its cupolas fell and the church remained in ruins until 1880, when, with the help of the Foundation of King Carol I, work started again, lasting until 1888. The vast interior was painted in 1887 by Gheorghe Tattarescu and the stained glass windows were completed by a Bavarian factory in Munich.
							In 1639, Vasile Lupu spent Moldavia's budget for the following year and a half to acquire the relics of St. Paraschiva from Constantinopole.<br/><br/> The relics were moved to the Metropolitan Cathedral in 1889 after a fire damaged the Trei Ierarchi Church where they had originally been placed.
							The cathedral still uses one of the original bells in its northeast spire. Inside the bell, an inscription says it was made from four cannons captured from the Turkish army in the War of 1828-1829. Nearby stands the 18th century Old Metropolitan Church of St. George (Biserica Sfantul Gheorghe).
							Every October 14, pilgrims from all corners of Romania and neighboring countries flock to Iasi to kneel before the blue and gold bier containing the relics of Saint Paraschiva, the patron saint of the cathedral. <br/><br/>

				<h1 class="content_headers">Bran, Romania</h1>
				<article  id="article2">
					<img src="/sites/worldtour/public/img/branatnight.jpg" alt="Bran" id="bran"> 
					Bran (German: Törzburg; Hungarian: Törcsvár) is a commune in Brașov County, Romania. It lies at 30 km from the city of Brașov and is composed of five villages: Bran, Poarta (Porta), Predeluț (Kispredeál), Șimon (Simon) and Sohodol (Szohodol).
					The medieval Bran Castle, which was once besieged by Vlad the Impaler, is a popular tourist destination, partly because it resembles the home of Dracula in Bram Stoker's famous novel. <span class="rmore">[Read more...]</span><br/><br/>

						<article id="hidden_article2">
							The Teutonic Order began construction of a wooden fort known as Dietrichstein in the early 13th century. After the fort's destruction in 1242 by Mongols, King Sigismund of Hungary ordered the construction of a stone castle in 1377, while the settlement of Bran began to develop nearby. Positioned high atop a steep cliff, the castle guarded a strategic trade route between Transylvania and Wallachia. In 1498, Bran fell under the jurisdiction of Braşov.<br/><br/>
							After the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire, Bran became part of the Principality of Transylvania during the 16th century, and eventually passed to the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria. The commune became part of the Austrian Empire in 1804 and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1866. It was added to the Kingdom of Romania following World War I.<br/><br/>
							Bran Castle is one of Romania's most popular visitor sites, made famous in modern times when Queen Marie restored it after receiving it from the residents of Brașov County in the 1920s. The castle is open to tourists, who can view the inside alone or as part of a guided tour. Outside the castle are examples of traditional Romanian farm houses and peasant homes. <span class="vless">[View less...]</span> <br/><br/>

							<h3>Count Dracula</h4><br>
							Dracula – as he is perceived today – is a fictitious character whose name derives from the appellation given to Vlad Tepes, the ruler of Wallachia from 1456-1462 and 1476, and who, for largely political reasons, was depicted by some historians of that time as a blood-thirsty ruthless despot.<br/><br/>
							Stoker’s character, Count Dracula, first appeared in the novel “Dracula”, published in England in 1897, by the Irish writer Bram Stoker. But the name “Dracula”, far from being a frightening term, derives from the Crusader Order of the Dragon with which Order both Vlad Tepes and his father had been associated. The rest of the Dracula myth derives from the legends and popular beliefs in ghosts and vampires prevalent throughout Transylvania.<br/><br/>
							Stoker’s Count Dracula is a centuries-old vampire, sorcerer, and Transylvanian nobleman, who claims to be a Székely descended from Attila the Hun. He inhabits a decaying castle in the Carpathian Mountains. In his conversations with the character Jonathan Harker, Dracula reveals himself as intensely proud of his boyar culture with a yearning for memories of his past. Count Dracula appears to have studied the black arts at the Academy of Scholomance in the Carpathian Mountains, near the town of Sibiu (then known as Hermannstadt). While Stoker named his Transylvanian Count “Dracula”, he was careful not to suggest an actual link to the historical character of Vlad Tepes. While Stoker’s character Van Helsing muses as to whether Count Dracula might be the Voivode Dracula, he obviously is not since Count Dracula of Transylvania is plainly not Prince Vlad Tepes of Wallachia and Stoker was disinclined at all to make his character a real person of historic significance.<br/><br/>
