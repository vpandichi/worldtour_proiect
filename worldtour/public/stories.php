					We decided to visit Italy in September and because the best place to describe the culture of this country is Sicily, we started to look for a place to stay and for plane tickets. After a bit of research we learned that many important civilizations had left their mark upon this island, such as Greeks, Romans, Turks and Arabs - this being easily seen in the architecture of the buildings. <br><br> When we planned our stay, we tried to rent something as close as possible to Fontanarossa airport but the prices were too high for us, and we ended up choosing Taormina. It was there that we found an apartment, situated in Giardini-Naxos, an old Greek colony, under the foothills of Mount Tauro.
					The plane tickets were about 200€ (two-ways) from airport Henri Coanda (Romania) to Fontanarossa and as for the rent this was very cheap, 125€ for a whole week. 
					<br><br>Once we made it to Giardini, we started to see the true Sicilian beauty: narrow quaint streets, numberless balconies embellished with religious themes and, of course, the clear blue sea that smelled of cleanliness. 
					On our first day we took part as observers at a religious ceremony dedicated to Saint Maria while having dinner on the seafront, waiting for the weariness from the trip to fade.
					What will forever rest in my memory are the marvelous tastes and flavors we tried every day: the pistachios gelato, canolli and granita, a juice made with ice that was very refreshing on the heat. 
					<br><br>We managed to take a walk to Castemolla from where we could see a gorgeous view, the sea's blue melting into the sky, the place where I found out the importance of siesta, being rushed by a vendor who wished to close its shop. 
					If you are wondering about the choice of restaurants I have to tell you that there are many options depending on what you want to try: pizza, pasta, spaghetti, most of the menus having pistachios as an ingredient.
					<br><br>Must sees are the Antique Theater with a lovely panorama, Isola Bella or the Etna Volcano.
					You can reach Isola Bella by taking the funivia and I will most surely recommend that you visit Etna through a tourism agency, having thus the advantage of a tour guide speaking about the history. It's worth every cent. 
					I don't advise paying for staying on a private beach as you will find rocks in the water and the same conditions you could enjoy on any beach.
					You shouldn't miss on going on a boat ride, it's about 20 euros, including refreshments, a stop to swim and a summary of the island's history. <br><br> All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I recommend this place to everybody. [...]
