1. Created provisory landing page
2. Ammended landing page and created javascript event listeners on scroll to dynamically change the display of the page
3. Fixed navigation and video bugs when being dynamically generated, added navigation effects
4. Fixed logo bug
5. Switched from a slideshow based landing page to a video based lpage, also changed the dynamic page's slideshow to a video. Modified lpage nav color. Added a banner below the actual page content starts.
6. Switched from if statements to switch statements as these are better fitted for my needs. Improved color scheme, removed red banner, changed to a blue gradient that fits the theme, created about me content. Added dynamic image in the banner area that changes position as you scroll. Changed scrollbar CSS for chrome.
7. Fixed boat bug overlapping navigation (needed z-index property)
8. Fixed major page bug - when clicking on the about link on the landing page it would scroll to the relevant content but wouldn't load the dynamic styles as it would normally when scrolling (needed to remove the && ypos < 7 condition as this caused the switch statement to always be false, therefore not firing the dynamic styles)
9. Designed about me area and added content, designed recommendations area and added content, designed contact form, designed footer area
10. Created provisory footer content
11. Amended footer style and content. Created design of recommendations page, added provisory content.
12. 90% of recommendations page completed, created design and added content. Added read more / view less buttons.
13. Finished recommendations page, created content for stories page, amended footer area for all pages.
