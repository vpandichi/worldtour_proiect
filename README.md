TO DO FOR TOMORROW 16/07: - fix logo not displaying on the nav bar after being dynamically generated; (might be a problem with the HTML positioning of the divs) - ok
                          - pick a def. color scheme - current red/green - debugging colors; - x
                          - create the about us page - x

TO DO FOR TOMORROW 17/07: - fix slider bug. The navigation becomes inactive when the video/image is behind it - it probably has to do with the fact that it has a position of static. Need to investigate. - fixed (it was the image covering the nav buttons, needed to adjust height/margin-top)
                          - pick a color scheme as I've only been using colors for testing until now - partially ok, needs adjustments
                          - pick a navigation color scheme for the landing page - only test colors 'til now - ok, needs small adjustments
                          - create content for the about page - x
