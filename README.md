1. Created provisory landing page (D1)
2. Ammended landing page and created javascript event listeners on scroll to change the display of the page (D2)
3. Fixed navigation and video bugs when being dynamically generated, added navigation effects (D3)

TO DO FOR TOMORROW 16/07: - fix logo not displaying on the nav bar after being dynamically generated; (might be a problem with the HTML positioning of the divs) - ok
                          - pick a def. color scheme - current red/green - debugging colors; - x
                          - create the about us page - x
4. Fixed logo bug.

TO DO FOR TOMORROW 17/07: - fix slider bug. The navigation becomes inactive when the video/image is behind it - it probably has to do with the fact that it has a position of static. Need to investigate.
                          - pick a color scheme as I've only been using colors for testing until now
                          - pick a navigation color scheme for the landing page - only test colors 'til now
                          - create content for the about page
